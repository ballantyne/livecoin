Livecoin
------------


Don't get me wrong.  I think that Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin are really cool.  I have also been hearing about altcoins and I wanted to learn more about them, so I looked into [Livecoin](https://livecoin.net/?from=Livecoin-ybRDrafb) because it has a huge variety of different altcoins available and really let me look into the cryptocurrency craze a little more closely.  Their website is kind of funny, showing the most pumped and the most dumped of the day, making no attempt at hiding that that is what is happening with these lesser known currencies.  

Usage
------------




I know that that is a little overkill, but I wanted to make a point about how many more currencies are available on Livecoin than there are on GDAX currently.  I like GDAX a lot, like I said, don't get me wrong, but there is room for more than GDAX in my currency trading life.
